Programming Assignment 2: Deques and Randomized Queues


/******************************************************************************
 *  Explain briefly how you implemented the randomized queue and deque.
 *  Which data structure did you choose (array, linked list, etc.)
 *  and why?
 *****************************************************************************/
 
	I chose to use the array data structure since I am most familiar with arrays
	and they make the most sense to me. Having not taken a Java class the 
	semester prior to this one, I am a tad rusty on my Java skills (primarily
	remembering the little things) and have been sticking to what I can relate to. 

/******************************************************************************
 *  How much memory (in bytes) do your data types use to store n items
 *  in the worst case? Use the 64-bit memory cost model from Section
 *  1.4 of the textbook and use tilde notation to simplify your answer.
 *  Briefly justify your answers and show your work.
 *
 *  Do not include the memory for the items themselves (as this
 *  memory is allocated by the client and depends on the item type)
 *  or for any iterators, but do include the memory for the references
 *  to the items (in the underlying array or linked list).
 *****************************************************************************/

Randomized Queue:   ~  _____  bytes

Deque:              ~  _____  bytes

/******************************************************************************
 *  Known bugs / limitations.
 *****************************************************************************/
	
	Subset.java is built to run on the command line.

/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
 *  Don't include readings, lectures, and precepts, but do
 *  include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs,
 *  classmates, and friends) and attribute them by name.
 *****************************************************************************/

	Most all of this assignment was done on my own at home. I did consult with
	a friend (Kris) who took this same class a few years ago on some of the
	implementation. 

/******************************************************************************
 *  If you worked with a partner, assert below that you followed
 *  the protocol as described on the assignment page. Give one
 *  sentence explaining what each of you contributed.
 *****************************************************************************/

	I did not work with a partner on this assignment.

/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 *****************************************************************************/

	None

/******************************************************************************
 *  List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback   
 *  on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether    
 *  you enjoyed doing it.                                             
 *****************************************************************************/
 
 	Java and I have a love/hate relationship, I am more fancy towards the web
 	based languages, such as JavaScript. However, I do appreciate what I learn
 	in Java because I have found that it helps me understand concepts in other
 	languages and provides me a nice foundation for programming.
